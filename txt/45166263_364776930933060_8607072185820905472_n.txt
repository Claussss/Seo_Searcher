in case / if in case + na ( mom ) anyzan, cam; 6 ( man ) cayrae, ecan; ghys um.g. in case means because it is possible. in case is not the same as if ( secure). we use in case to say why sub does or doesn't do south, you do smith now in case smith happens later. do not use a future tense after in case, use a present tense ! ex.: 1) we will buy some more food in case tom comes. " ) we will buy some food if tom comes . you can use in case + a past tense to say why sub did south. ex: we bought some more food in case tom came. (sbecause it was possible that tom would come)  2018-10

the position of prepositions in relative clauses do you know the man? - tom is talking to him- do you know the man (who/ that ) tom is talking to the bed - i slept [in it last night- was comfortable" the bed ( that ( which) i slept in last night was conf. in all these examples, you can have out who / that / which whom whom is possible instead of who when it is the object of the verb in the relative clause. you can also use whom with a preposition, but you have to put it before whom ( to whom / from whom etc.)! e. g. 1) do you know the man to whom tom is talking? the woman whom i wanted to see was away on holiday but we do not often use whom. in spoken english we usually prefer who or that, or nothing.

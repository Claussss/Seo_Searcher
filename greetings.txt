Hey, {}, what's up?

I am SEO Searcher, and I can search for different lessons from SOE by using keywords from the topics.
Also, I have built-in google translator, so you can write keywords in Russian or Ukrainian.
I have all the lessons from the beginning to November 2019.

Here are a few tips how to use me:

----1) Enter the KEYWORDS you can remember from a topic. As a separator use SPACE.

WARNING: in one message you can write only keywords from THE SAME topic, otherwise I will send you nothing

----2) The MORE keywords, the more specific the search.

For instance, you can write 'exposed to' or just 'exposed', 'помнить', 'пам'ятати'.
You can mention a few key words from ONE topic, such as 'disappointed  devoted to discriminated', 'much many' or 'рисковать'.

-------BONUS-------
Furthermore, if you send me a date by using this template
'YEAR-MONTH', I will send you all the lessons of that month.
For example, '2019-11' or '2018-01'.

Now send me something!
